__**5. Do not mini-mod**__
If you do not have a staff position, you have no reason to act like staff. Reporting to us is okay, but do not tell staff how to run the server, do not go through the channels and tell us what's wrong, do not tell us that some of the channels needs to be updated. You are not staff and its most likely that we already know!

__**6. Keep most content in the correct channel!**__
Roleplaying channels are used for roleplaying and not offtopic messages about your day. The offtopics are meant for any kind of talk if its sharing memes or videos! But please do keep the vents in the vent channel! OOC will not be taken lightly and if we have to continuously delete it from the channels from you, we will have to give you a warning, the Offtopic channels are there for OOC! 

__**7. Do not post ChainMail or advertisement!**__
Please do not post any kind of chainmail! Example of 'Send this to (insert number here) different servers to (insert something here)' or those pictures using numbers, emoji's, ect. It will be considered as spam and you will receive a warning! No advertising any server, in dms or in the server at all! This will be a automatic kick to new people and a warning to those that are active rper's.

__**8. Do not bring up and kind of political/religious/etc. topics!**__
Those types of topics can start arguments so please just don't bring up anything that will cause fights! This includes talking about communism, who the president is and much more!(edited)
If you have more questions, please do not be afraid to dm any staff member! :heart:
